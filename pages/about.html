    <h3>Origin of the Universe</h3>
    <hr>
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>The term “the Universe” is derived from the Latin word “universum”, which was used by Roman statesman Cicero
        and later Roman authors to refer to the world and the cosmos as they knew it. This consisted of the Earth and
        all living creatures that dwelt therein, as well as the Moon, the Sun, the then-known planets (Mercury, Venus,
        Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) and the stars. The term “cosmos” is often used interchangeably with the Universe. It is
        derived from the Greek word "kosmos", which literally means “the world”. Other words commonly used to define the
        entirety of existence include “Nature” (derived from the Germanic word "natur") and the English word
        “everything”,
        who's use can be seen in scientific terminology — i.e. “Theory Of Everything” (TOE). Today, this term is often
        to used to refer to all things that exist within the known Universe — the Solar System, the Milky Way, and all
        known galaxies and superstructures. In the context of modern science, astronomy and astrophysics, it also refers
        to all spacetime, all forms of energy (i.e. electromagnetic radiation and matter) and the physical laws that
        bind them.

      <p>Ptolemy placed the Earth at the centre of his geocentric model. Using the data he had, Ptolemy thought that the
        universe was a set of nested spheres surrounding the Earth. He believed that the Moon was orbiting on a sphere
        closest to the Earth, followed by Mercury, then Venus and then the Sun. Beyond the Sun were a further three
        spheres on which Mars, then Jupiter and then Saturn orbited the Earth. Finally, the outmost sphere was where all
        the stars were located in the 48 constellations that Ptolemy described in his text. It wasnt until 1543 that
        Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a revised model putting the Sun at the centre — the
        heliocentric model of the universe

        The most well-supported idea for the creation of our universe revolves around an event known as the big bang.
        This notion arose from the discovery that other galaxies are rapidly moving away from our own in all directions,
        as if propelled by a powerful ancient explosive force. In the first 10^-43 seconds of its existence, the
        universe
        was very compact, less than a million billion billionth the size of a single atom. It's also thought that the
        extremely close quarters allowed the universe's very first particles to mix, mingle, and settle into roughly the
        same temperature. Then, in an unimaginably small fraction of a second, all that matter and energy expanded
        outward more or less evenly, with tiny variations provided by fluctuations on the quantum scale. That model of
        breakneck
        expansion, called inflation, may explain why the universe has such an even temperature and distribution of
        matter.
        After inflation, the universe continued to expand but at a much slower rate. It's still unclear what exactly
        powered inflation.

          The name "Earth" is derived from both English and German words, 'eorthe' and 'erde', respectively, which mean
          ground
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The Romans named the 5 planets visible with the naked eye Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Mercury
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Space spreads out infinitely in all directions and is always expanding, this evident by the fact that all
          observable galaxies are moving away from us
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Jupiter, the largest planet in the Milky Way galaxy, also has the largest moon in our solar system, Ganymede
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Black holes are areas in space with a gravitational pull so strong that even light cannot escape it
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The Boomerang Nebula is located in the constellation Centaurus and is the coldest place in the universe with a
          temperature of 1 Kelvin
